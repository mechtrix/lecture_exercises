# Your personal R environment

Below you can see R running in the browser. 
It is not as powerful as if we install R on the machine, but it spares us the hassle of setting R up on every of your Computers.
You can type some simple math to try it out!
You can run single lines by pressing `Ctrl` + `Enter`.

# loading libraries

As most open source software, R builds upon loading libraries. 
Usually those are found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), but in our case they need to be provided.
Let's try loading libraries!

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)
```

Here we have loaded the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package, which is used for data manipulation.
It is part of the much bigger [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
Since the packages always have to be installed, we will not use the more extensive command `library(tidyverse)`.
This would trigger to install a lot of packages.
If you want to do this on your own machine, please do so
